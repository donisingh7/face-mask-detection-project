# face-mask-detection-project
This project is a facemask detection model using convolutional neural networks in Python. The project uses the Keras deep learning library and TensorFlow backend to classify images into two categories: with mask and without mask. The dataset consists of two sets, training and testing, and uses an image data generator to preprocess the images. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and dense layers, followed by a sigmoid activation function. The accuracy of the model is measured using binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics. Finally, the model is used to predict whether an individual in a single image is wearing a facemask or not.
